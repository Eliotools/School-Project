1 - Introduction


      This memo provides information about the R-Type UDP protocols. The 
      R-Type is a third year project from EPITECH.

      The goal of the R-Type project is to create an online multiplayer 
      copy of the classic R-Type game (1987).
      
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
      this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2 - R-Type architecture

      The R-Type architecture is a classic client-server game 
      architecture.
      All the game engine is on the server. The client talks to the 
      server by using the R-Type UDP protocol.
      Multiple clients can connect to the server and join a game at the 
      same time. When the client is connected, he automatically starts a
      new game or joins the current game if one is already started.

3 - R-Type UDP Protocol

      All the communications ( client-server & server-client ) are done 
      by using this R-Type UDP Protocol.
      Every transmission done with the R-Type UDP Protocol MUST transmit
      a header containing a header and a body

3.a Header

      The header contain informations about the type of the datas that 
      are sent


        1 _ _ :: Connection
              1 1 _ :: Client
                    1 1 1 :: First Connection
                    1 1 2 :: Response client_id [ client_id ]

              1 2 _ :: Server
                    1 2 1 :: Sending client_id [client_id]

        2 _ _ :: Informations
              2 1 _ :: Client
                    2 1 1 :: Sending input [client_id; input_id]

              2 2 _ :: Server
                    2 2 1 :: Sending Draw pos [sprite_id; pos_x; pos_y]

        3 _ _ :: End of game
                    3 1 0 :: Game Win
                    3 2 0 :: Game Over
                    3 3 0 :: Close Window

3.b Body

      The body contain sent datas. It could be empty [ null ] or filled 
      by binary numbers

        1 1 1 :: [ null ]
        1 1 2 :: [ client_id ]
        1 2 1 :: [ client_id ]
        2 1 1 :: [ client_id; input_id ]
        2 2 1 :: [ sprite_id; pos_x; pos_y ]
        3 1 0 :: [ null ]
        3 2 0 :: [ null ]
        3 3 0 :: [ null ]
